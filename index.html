	<div id="application"><h5>Statement of Purpose: Émilie Brunet</h5><h6>Application to Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), Fall 2020
Major in Graphic Design and Visual Communication (Atlanta Campus)</h6>

Dear Committee,<br>
The future of graphic design and visual communication is one that is in a constant state of evolution and advancement. I believe that the most successful designers of the future will be those who have accumulated a holistic knowledge of design and communications. These designers will need to be able to prove their value as adaptable creators in a world where technology becomes both more capable of performing human tasks and more accessible to the public. I believe that the realm of what is considered graphic design will continue to expand to include a more digital scope. <br>
I am a designer who can adapt quickly to change and realize creativity on a variety of platforms to produce quality design work. Throughout my undergraduate studies in design at Concordia University in Montreal, I have been exposed to a diverse education in design studies. The program has provided me with a solid understanding of graphic design and web design while also introducing me industrial and sustainable design. I have taken graphic design classes with a focus on visual communication in print which gave me the skills necessary to execute designs for a variety of print formats. During my second year in the program I was fortunate to learn from type designer professor Natalie Dumont who gave a comprehensive teaching on type design which included the use of Glyphs to create three original typefaces. I have also thoroughly enjoyed taking classes in web design and user experience where I went through the full process of taking a design from a UX map and wireframes to a fully developed responsive website.<br>
My extra-curricular experiences have also greatly contributed to my design education. Volunteering at art and design related events such as ATypI and Art Matters has exposed me to both local and global figures in the field, and to current developments in visual communication. Art Matters is a Concordia University student run art festival that takes place every year within many galleries across Montreal. I volunteered for the festival in 2017 and experienced various roles including gallery docent and server at a vernissage. When I volunteered at ATypI 2017 in Montreal, I had the privilege of attending lectures by famous type designers at this international type design conference. I met with highly successful professionals in the industry and gained knowledge in the most pertinent issues and current developments in type design.<br>
I have also earned professional experience as a design intern in Ottawa Ontario with Synacor, an international multi-platform technology development agency. There I was exposed to user experience design for both mobile applications and web technologies. I have also worked as a freelance graphic and web designer for The Ottawa Riverkeeper, an organization that works to protect waterways in the Ottawa and Gatineau regions. For this job I learned how to work closer with clients and single-handedly deliver quality work to them in a timely fashion.<br>
While I have researched many design majors from across the world, the graphic design and visual communications program at SCAD sets itself apart from all the rest. Their modern approach to graphic design and focus on user experience design is what really intrigues me about this program. I am also interested in learning from award winning graphic design professor Peter Wong, who’s extensive knowledge in graphic design could help me develop stronger skills in this domain. I appreciate his minimalistic graphic style and use of strong colours and imagery to create visual engagement as can be seen with his work for Sun Life Financial and Paralucent. I believe that his expertise with print media and advertising would prepare me well for my future endeavours in graphic design. I am also particularly excited by the possibilities to work with industry professionals and forge connections on a global scale. As well, since this masters program is offered at multiple campuses, I would be very keen in passing a portion of my degree at the Hong Kong campus. I believe that this experience overall would set me apart and hopefully this leg up might lead to better future job opportunities.<br>
I am most interested in entering the field of interface and user experience design for its applications to digital and web platforms in particular. This being a relatively new field of study, it is exciting to have the opportunity to pursue my research in this domain at a graduate level. In my past projects, I have had a focus on creating interactive design that deals with environmental and social justice issues. I would like to continue my focus in this area while introducing a greater attention to accessibility and sustainability in my future projects. As technology becomes more accessible, it is important to consider all audiences and the impact of creating new interfaces, and I want to be a part of this change.
Thus far in my academic and professional career as a designer, I have learned that a good designer is always multifaceted. They wear many hats and must above all else be a creative individual who is up to taking on new challenges. I am always seeking out ways of improving my technical abilities by learning software, techniques, and design practices both old and new. I would like to have a part in bringing these ideas to organizations through design. With the knowledge that I can acquire from this master's degree, I will make this dream a reality.
<br>
Thank you for your consideration,<br>
Émilie Brunet
